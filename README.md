# fleet-man

A CLI/TUI tool for managing fleets of devcontainers. Spawn, name, exec into, and manage multiple devcontainer instances easily

## Install

```bash
sudo curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenjaminBenetti/fleet-man/main/install.sh | sh
```

To install a specific version:

```bash
sudo curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenjaminBenetti/fleet-man/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --version v0.2.0
```

## Usage

Run `fleet` with no arguments to launch the interactive TUI, or use subcommands directly:

```bash
# Launch TUI
fleet

# Spawn instances from the current repo
fleet up agent-1
fleet up agent-2

# Stop and restart an existing instance without removing it
fleet stop agent-1
fleet start agent-1

# List instances
fleet ls

# Exec into an instance
fleet exec agent-1 bash

# Open VS Code on an instance
fleet code agent-1

# View logs
fleet logs agent-1

# Remove an instance
fleet down agent-1

# Remove a fleet and all its instances
fleet destroy my-project

# Spawn from anywhere with explicit repo
fleet up agent-1 --repo git@github.com:org/my-project.git

# Reference an existing fleet from anywhere
fleet up my-project/agent-3
```

## Requirements

- Linux, including Ubuntu on WSL2
- Docker
- [devcontainer CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) (`npm install -g @devcontainers/cli`)

## Windows WSL Setup

Fleet is a Linux CLI, but it can run on Windows through WSL2. The confirmed
setup is:

- Ubuntu on WSL2
- Docker Desktop with WSL integration enabled for the Ubuntu distro
- Node installed with `nvm`
- `@devcontainers/cli` installed under the nvm-managed Node
- Fleet installed somewhere on the WSL `PATH`, such as `~/.local/bin/fleet`

Inside WSL:

```bash
nvm install 22
nvm alias default 22
nvm use default
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

On Docker Desktop plus WSL, if devcontainer startup fails while building the
UID-adjustment or feature image, disable BuildKit for Fleet-managed
devcontainers. If the failure is specifically in `updateUID.Dockerfile`,
disable the devcontainer CLI's remote user UID rewrite as well:

```bash
export FLEET_DEVCONTAINER_BUILDKIT=never
export FLEET_DEVCONTAINER_UPDATE_REMOTE_USER_UID=never
```

To persist that setting:

```bash
echo 'export FLEET_DEVCONTAINER_BUILDKIT=never' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export FLEET_DEVCONTAINER_UPDATE_REMOTE_USER_UID=never' >> ~/.bashrc
```

See [Windows WSL notes](docs/windows-wsl-notes.md) for a full health check and
disposable smoke-test workflow.

## Devcontainer BuildKit

Fleet uses the devcontainer CLI's default BuildKit behavior unless explicitly
configured. If Docker Desktop on WSL fails while building the devcontainer
UID-adjustment image, disable BuildKit for Fleet-managed devcontainers:

```bash
export FLEET_DEVCONTAINER_BUILDKIT=never
```

Accepted values are `auto` and `never`.

## Devcontainer UID Rewrite

Fleet uses the devcontainer CLI's default remote-user UID/GID rewrite behavior
unless explicitly configured. On Docker Desktop plus WSL, that rewrite can fail
while building `updateUID.Dockerfile`. To disable it for Fleet-managed
devcontainers:

```bash
export FLEET_DEVCONTAINER_UPDATE_REMOTE_USER_UID=never
```

Accepted values are `default`, `never`, `on`, and `off`.
